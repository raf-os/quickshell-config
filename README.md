My own personal quickshell config.

These files should be located in:

```
~/.config/quickshell
```

A bunch of the early code and structure was based off of the [Caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell) shell. It's more feature complete and customizable, so maybe go check it out if it interests you.
